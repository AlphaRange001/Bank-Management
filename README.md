Hello everyone, Vivek here! I have created a Bank Management System using the concepts of Swing and AWT. This project encompasses the complete lifecycle of banking operations, starting from 
account creation to cash withdrawal at an ATM. Here's an overview of the features and functionalities:

Account Creation: Users can open a new bank account by providing necessary details. This module ensures that all required information is captured accurately.

Account Management: Users can view and update their account information. This includes updating personal details and managing contact information.

PIN Generation: After account creation, users can set up a secure PIN for their account. This PIN is crucial for authenticating transactions at ATMs.

Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit money into their accounts and withdraw cash from ATMs. The system accurately processes these transactions, updating account balances accordingly.

Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history, providing transparency and accountability for all banking activities.

ATM Simulation: The project includes a simulation of ATM transactions. Users can perform withdrawals, check their balance, and update their PIN through a user-friendly interface.

Security Features: The system incorporates basic security measures to protect user information and ensure secure transactions.

Graphical User Interface: Utilizing Swing and AWT, the project features an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface, making the system easy to navigate and use.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project was to simulate the internal processes of a bank, providing a clear understanding of how various banking operations are managed from the backend. This includes:

Understanding the Workflow: From account creation to cash withdrawals, the project mimics real-life banking workflows.
Learning GUI Development: Implementing the project using Swing and AWT has enhanced my skills in creating robust and user-friendly interfaces.
Security Awareness: Implementing basic security features has provided insights into the importance of protecting user data in banking systems.
Future Enhancements
While the current version of the Bank Management System covers the essential functionalities, there are several areas for potential enhancement:

Advanced Security Measures: Implementing encryption and more sophisticated authentication methods.
Loan and Credit Management: Adding modules for managing loans, credits, and interest calculations.
Customer Support: Integrating a support system to assist users with their banking queries and issues.
Online Banking: Expanding the system to support online banking features, allowing users to perform transactions over the internet.
Thank you for checking out my project. I hope you find it informative and helpful in understanding the inner workings of a bank's management system.
